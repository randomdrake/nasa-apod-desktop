# 
# DESCRIPTION
# 1) Grabs your current download path
# 2) Downloads the latest image of the day from NASA (http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/)
# 3) Determines your desktop resolution, or uses the set default.
# 4) Resizes the image to the given resolution.
# 5) Sets the image as your desktop.
# 6) Adds image to XML file used to scroll through desktop background images.
#
# It's not very exciting to scroll through a single image, so it will attempt to download 
# additional images (default: 10) to seed your list of images.
#
# 
# INSTALLATION
# Place the file wherever you like and chmod +x it to make it executable
# Ensure you have Python installed (default for Ubuntu) and the PIL and lxml packages:
# pip install -f requirements.txt or sudo apt-get install python-imaging python-lxml
# 
#
# RUN AT STARTUP
# To have this run whenever you startup your computer, perform the following steps:
# 1) Click on the settings button (cog in top right)
# 2) Select "Startup Applications..."
# 3) Click the "Add" button
# 4) Enter whatever Name and Comment you like with the following Command:
# python /path/to/nasa_apod_desktop.py
# 5) Click on the "Add" button
# 
# DEFAULTS
# While the script will detect as much as possible and has safe defaults, you may want to set your own.
# 
# DOWNLOAD_PATH  - where you want the file to be downloaded. Will be auto-detected if not set.
# CUSTOM_FOLDER  - if we detect your download folder, this will be the target folder in there.
# RESOUTION_TYPE - 
#     'stretch': single monitor or the combined resolution of your available monitors
#     'largest': largest resolution of your available monitors
#     'default': use the default resolution that is set
# RESOLUTION_X   - horizontal resolution if RESOLUTION_TYPE is not default or cannot be 
#                  automatically determined
# RESOLUTION_Y   - vertical resolution if RESOLUTION_TYPE is not default or cannot be
#                  automatically determined
# NASA_APOD_SITE - location of the current picture of the day
# IMAGE_SCROLL   - if true, will write also write an XML file to make the images scroll
# IMAGE_DURATION - if IMAGE_SCROLL is enabled, this is the duration each will stay in seconds
# SEED_IMAGES    - if > 0, it will download previous images as well to seed the list of images
# SHOW_DEBUG     - print useful debugging information or statuses
